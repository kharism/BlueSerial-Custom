Blue Serial
===========

Blue Serial is an Android app which is compatible and tested on Android versions 2.2 to 4.2.2. The app itself is designed to allow for Serial communications over Bluetooth to devices such as Arduino. It has been tested with the JY-MCU serial bluetooth module but there is no reason to believe that it won't work with any other device.

It is fairly straightforward and allows for 2 way communication.

This project is customized BlueSerial with some parser so you can add another parser for you project.
